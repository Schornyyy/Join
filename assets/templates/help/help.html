  <h3>What is Join</h3>
  <p>
    Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group
    of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the
    Developer Akademie.
    <br />
    Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to
    visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
    Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and
    projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
    <br />
    It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and
    is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the
    best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability,
    reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.

        <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
        <p>
          When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board
          represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In
          Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
        </p>

        <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
        <p>
          In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to
          the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
          required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks
          and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
        <p>
          Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
          represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate
          list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
          task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
        <p>
          As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
          the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
        <p>
          Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or
          delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board.
          Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
          irreversible. Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent
          updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the
          current state of your project. Have more questions about Join? Feel
